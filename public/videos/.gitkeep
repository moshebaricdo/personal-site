# Video assets directory

Project demo videos and motion assets.

## Recommendations

- Use MP4 with H.264 codec for broad compatibility
- Keep file sizes reasonable (aim for <5MB for thumbnails)
- Consider WebM as additional format for better compression

## Structure

- /projects/{project-slug}/
  - demo.mp4      - Main project demo video
  - thumb.mp4     - Short loop for thumbnail (if using video thumbnails)
