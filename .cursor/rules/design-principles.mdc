# Portfolio Design Principles

This portfolio follows design principles inspired by elite product designer portfolios (Josh Puckett, Brian Lovin, Raphael Salaja, Noah Levin).

## Core Philosophy

### Restraint Over Decoration
- No gradients, excessive shadows, or rounded corners everywhere
- No mixing multiple font families unnecessarily
- Every element must earn its place

### Whitespace Is Design
- Generous spacing is intentional, not padding
- Let content breathe - don't fill every gap
- Negative space creates hierarchy and focus

### Color as Reward
- Base aesthetic is near-monochrome (black, white, grays)
- Color appears on interaction (hover, focus) not everywhere
- One accent color maximum, used sparingly

### One Signature Interaction
- Each page should have one memorable micro-interaction
- Examples: blur-focus effect, morphing menu, letter-by-letter reveal
- Quality over quantity - one perfect detail beats ten mediocre ones

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```
❌ Generic Tailwind utility soup without intentionality
❌ Gradients and shadows on everything
❌ Multiple competing accent colors
❌ Animations without purpose
❌ Decorative elements that don't serve content
❌ Stock photography or placeholder content
```

## Quality Checklist

Before shipping any component:
- [ ] Does it work without color? (monochrome test)
- [ ] Is the spacing consistent with our rhythm?
- [ ] Does the hover state feel intentional?
- [ ] Would removing any element improve it?
- [ ] Does it pass the "is this a template?" test?
