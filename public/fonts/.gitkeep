# Font files directory

Custom font files for the portfolio.

## Required Fonts

- signifier-regular.woff2   - Primary serif font (headings)
- signifier-medium.woff2    - Medium weight variant (optional)

## Font Loading

Fonts are preloaded in the root layout for optimal performance.
Only include weights that are actually used to minimize bundle size.

## Licensing

Ensure you have proper licenses for any custom fonts used.
System fonts (system-ui) are used for body text and don't require files.
